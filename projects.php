            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Balancing work, school, and personal responsibilities often leads to procrastination and stress, particularly when users feel guilty for relaxing after completing tasks. The goal was to design a mobile app that integrates multiple schedules and uses AI to create an hour-by-hour plan to alleviate these issues.</p>

         <!-- project 3 -->

         <h6> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The Problem </h6>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With resumes being limited to just one page. I felt that I had so much more to show off about myself than this limited real estate could provide. At the same time, I wanted to learn PHP to expand my horizons and skill set. To kill two birds with one stone I created this Webresume in July of 2024. Then in November of the same year, My UX/UI Course required me to create a mock-up of a Web portfolio. So I decided to fold that into this Resume to further expound on both. 
            </p>
            
            <h6> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Tools Used</h6>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>VS Code: </b> The main IDE I used to develop This website <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>XXAMP: </b> Used as a local server host so I could see my code changes in real-time. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Blue Host:</b> This is my internet server that allows employers and friends to see my resume on the internet.  <br>
            
            <h6> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Discovery Phases </h6>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the hard skills I used YouTube tutorials. Specifically <a id="inline" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ6vybT1HQs"> This one</a> by Brocode. As well as the CSCI 145 course I took at Montana State.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The layout of the webpage was based on other web resumes I found online. It was also inspired by conversations I've had with my professors as well as recruiters.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The graphics and color scheme are a mix of my personal style and suggestions from friends who I informally surveyed about this website. <br> 
            </p>

            <h6> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Application of Usability Heuristics</h6>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Visibility of System Status:</b>  The browser tab dynamically updates to reflect the current page (e.g., "About" when on the About page). <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>User Control and Freedom:</b>  A consistent navigation menu allows users to switch between pages seamlessly. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Consistency and Standards:</b>  Headers and footers retain their position and design across pages.  <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design:</b>  Earthy tones and nature-inspired images complement a clean layout, with one core element per page to avoid clutter.<br>
